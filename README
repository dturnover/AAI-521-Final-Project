*EfficientNet*
EfficientNet is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) model developed by Google Research. 
It is designed to improve upon existing CNN architectures by scaling up model capacity while maintaining high accuracy and efficient use of resources.
EfficientNet is based on a compound scaling method that scales model capacity in a more structured and efficient manner.
This allows the model to achieve superior performance on a wide range of tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.
One key feature of EfficientNet is its use of a novel convolutional block, called the MBConv block, which is designed to reduce the number of parameters and computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. 
The MBConv block uses depth-wise separable convolutions and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) modules to improve model capacity and efficiency. 
In addition to its efficient use of resources, EfficientNet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including the ImageNet and COCO datasets. For example, EfficientNet-B7, the largest model in the EfficientNet family, achieves an accuracy of 84.3% on ImageNet while using only 66 million parameters, which is significantly less than other state-of-the-art models.
However, a limitation of EfficientNet-B0 is that it requires a large amount of computational resources to train and deploy. 
EfficientNet models are large and complex, which can make them challenging to train on standard hardware.
We can view the number of trainable parameters involved in our model construction: 4,016,515.
